After breakfast, a short City Tour by coach will commence in Heidelberg. Visit the Aldstadt or the Old Town, and be taken aback by the historical yet astounding unspoiled structures around. Then afterward, have a photo stop at Heidelberg Castle which stood atop the hills. Then proceed Cologne for your city tour, led by its famous cathedral whose Filigree Twin Spires dominate the skyline. Traverse along the alleys and find yourself tasting their local breweries and cuisine, must not be missed! Truly visiting Germany will leave you saying “Schonn!” Re-board and say good-bye to Germany and say Hello to Netherlands. Dinner and check in.
