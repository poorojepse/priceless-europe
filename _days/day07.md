After breakfast, say goodbye to Lucerne as we drive to Shaffhausen to see and feel the largest falls in Europe, the Rhinefalls. Take a moment to enjoy the sound of the rustling leaves and the roaring waterfalls. Then continue to the mysterious side of the Black Forest Region in Germany, mainly named because of its thick and dense forest trails blocking the natural light in the area. Visit also Titisee for a Cuckoo Clock demonstration, to learn how intricate the process was for making this piece. After, proceed to Heidelberg. Dinner then check in.
