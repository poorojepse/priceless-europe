After breakfast, begin with The Château de Versailles, which has been on UNESCO’s World Heritage list for 30 years, is one of the most beautiful achievements of 18th-century French art. The site began as Louis XIII’s hunting lodge before his son Louis XIV transformed and expanded it, moving the court and government of France to Versailles in 1682. Each of the three French kings who lived there until the French Revolution added improvements to make it more beautiful. Walk on its majestic rooms & halls which leaves you a view from the past ways of the monarchs in Paris. Then proceed to the famous shopping galleries at La Fayette to shop for you and your loved ones back home. Back to hotel for dinner and overnight.
