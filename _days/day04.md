After hotel breakfast, be ready to visit The City on Water- Venice Island. Get lost on the mazed-like alleys but be impressed upon finally reaching the architectural masterpiece of the early 15th century such as II Campanile de San Marco a magnificent bell tower built in the center of St. Mark's Square in the front of Basilica de San Marco. Then learn the art of turning raw materials into elegant pieces though the Murano glass blowing demonstration. Have dinner and overnight at the hotel.
